# Getting Started with JavaScript

The purpose of this tutorial is to step through getting started with JavaScript and WordPress. The Gutenberg Handbook documentation contains information on the APIs available for working with the block editor.

The goal of this tutorial is get you comfortable on how to use the API reference and snippets of code found within.

### What is JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language which is loaded and executated in your web browser; compared to PHP which is run by a web server with the results sent to the browser, typically as HTML.

The Block Editor introduced in WordPress 5.0 is written entirely in JavaScript, with the code run in the browser, and not on the server, it allows for a richer and more dynamic user experience.
